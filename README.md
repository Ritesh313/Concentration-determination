# Concentration-determination
The task of my project is to determine concentration of a user while watching any lecture or any video. While watching an online video which has become more common during the time of this project, a user cannot stay focused throughout a long duration lecture video. Hence a tool which can tell during which part the user was distracted would come in handy which would help user to only revisit the particular part of the video in which they were not focused, instead of watching the whole video again. The final output will be a csv file which will log a userâ€™s concentration throughout the lecture video. This csv file will have 4 columns: timestamp (the time duration of the video), facial expression (emotion at each time, this can be changed from seconds to a couple of seconds for a longer video), drowsiness (yes or no) and the Concentration (whether the user is focused or distracted).
